# Unreleased

- Remove `true` -> `nil` and `false` -> `nil` mutations. [#1018](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1018)

# v0.9.8 2020-08-02

* Change to generic catch all node mutator. This allows better cross parser version compatibility.

# v0.9.7 2020-07-22

* Bump parser dependency to 2.7.1, note this still does not support Ruby 2.7 syntax.
  But it supports running bundling with that parser version.
* Nail diff-lcs to 1.3 till output difference for 1.4 can be addressed.

# v0.9.6 2020-04-20

* Dependencies upgrade, should not change user facing semantics.
* Bump license nudge to 40s

# v0.9.5 2020-02-02

* Change to 2.7 parser series.
  This does not drop support for < 2.7 but enables to in the future add full Ruby 2.7 support.

# v0.9.4 2020-01-03

* Bump unparser dependency

# v0.9.3 2020-01-03

* Change to soft dependency on mutant-license.
  Rationale its fine to bundle mutant if not used.
  This can easily happen on transitive dependencies.
