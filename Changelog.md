  [Fix #1228]

# v0.10.29 2021-03-08

* [#1221](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1221)

* [#1218](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1218)

  * Remove integer literal negation mutations (`1` -> `-1`).

* [#1220](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1220)

  * Ignore methods defined in non `.rb` files during matching.

# v0.10.27 2021-02-02

* [#1216](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1216)

  Fix exception serialization form rails infected code bases.
  This case can happen when the killfork terminates abnormal,
  and the resulting exception in the worker has to be propagated to
  the main process for reporting.
  On "normal" Ruby the exceptions are dump/loadable but rails and
  its core extensions break this invariant. Hence mutant now
  captures the essence of the exception in an attribute copy for
  propagation.

* [#1207](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1207)

  * Remove `#eql?` -> `#equal?` mutation

* [#1210](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1210)

* [#1201](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1201)

  * Add `/\Astatic/` -> `#start_with?` mutations:
    * `a.match(/\Atext/)` -> `b.start_with?('text')`
    * `a.match?(/\Atext/)` -> `b.start_with?('text')`
    * `a =~ /\Atext/` -> `b.start_with?('text')`
  * Add `/static\z/` -> `#end_with?` mutations:
    * `a.match(/text\z/)` -> `b.end_with?('text')`
    * `a.match?(/text\z/)` -> `b.end_with?('text')`
    * `a =~ /text\z/` -> `b.end_with?('text')`

* [#1200](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1200)

* [#1205](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1205)

    Useful to verify which tests mutant detects as candiates for test selection.

* [#1204](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1204)

  * Allow constants to be passed to minitest integrations `cover` declaration.
    `cover SomeClass` is equivalent to `cover 'SomeClass*'`.

* [#1194](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1194)

  * Add mutation from named capturing group to non-capturing group:  `/(?<foo>bar)/` -> `/(?:bar)`.

      * `a.b?` -> `true`

  - `/a*?/` -> `/a+?/`
  - `/a*+/` -> `/a++/`

* [#1188](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1188)

  Add `a === b` -> `a.is_a?(b)` mutation

  [#1185](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1185)

  Allow [subject matcher configuration](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#matcher)
  in the configuration file.

* [#1166](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1166)

  Reintroduce regexp mutation support

# v0.10.23 2020-12-30

* [#1179](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1181)

  * Remove unuseful kwarg mutations.
  * Remove argument promotion on kwarg mutations. These yield AST that
    when unparsed have invalid syntax.

# v0.10.22 2020-12-26

* [#1178](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1178)

  * Add ruby-3.0 syntax and mutation support.

# v0.10.21 2020-12-23

* [#1174](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1174)

  * Add mutation from `#any?` to `#all?` and vice versa.

* [#1069](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1096)

  * Add GIL scaling and memory optimization via intermediary sub-processes.
    This architecture improves mutant performance slightly on the average (incremental)
    case but has a significant increase for longer coverage runs.
    Mostly this process model reduces the friction from forking from an ever
    growing main process.
    Also it reduces the chance of GC amplification, while enabling future
    optimizations in the area.

# v0.10.20 2020-12-16

  [#1159](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1159)
  [#1160](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1160)

  * Substantially improve performance on coverage attempts that involve many selected tests.
  * Reduce (but not eliminate) performance degeneration on larger subject sets.
  * This release for many average cases should get 2x the performance.

# v0.10.19 2020-12-14

* [#1158](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1158)

  * Change to strict integration version bounds.
  * Mutant is evolving the integration interface, and will keep doing so.
  * Before this change integrations would declare they can work with many
    future mutant releases, but this is actually not the case.

* [#1155](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1155)

  * Add `defined?(@a)` -> `instance_variable_defined?(:@a)` mutation.
  * Remove invalid mutations from `defined?` -> `true`.
  * Remove mutations of `defined?()` arguments, the `defined?` method
    is not fully evaluating the argument but instead partially evaluates the
    AST, or inspects the AST.
    Delegating to the value semantics based "generic" mutation engine does create
    too many hard to cover mutations.

# v0.10.18 2020-12-13

* [#1151](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1151)

  * Add support for unicode ruby method names.
  * Fixes long standing bug on expression parsing of method operators.
    This means that mutant is now selecting a more narrow / correct set of
    tests for operators.
    As a side effect measure coverage may drop. But for a good reason as mutant
    before would select way more tests even if a specific test for such an operator
    was available. Enforcing that this specific test actually covers the subject.

* [#1152](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1152)

  * Fix matching non existing constants.

* [#1153](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1153)

  * Improve minitest integration to also render minitest failures in reports.
    This is useful when reacting to noop errors.

* [#1154](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1154)

  * Add subcommand `environment subject list`. It allows to list
    all matched subjects.

# v0.10.17 2020-12-09

* Fix low frequency stuck isolation reads.

  [#1147](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1147)

  [#1125](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1125)

# v0.10.8 2020-11-22

* Add support for process abort as coverage condition.

  This allows mutation to be covered on abnormal process aborts, such as segfaults.

  [#1120](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/pull/1120)

# v0.10.7 2020-11-22

* Add support for external mutation timeouts.

  New config file settings. `mutation_timeout` and `coverage_criteria`
  to control timeouts and coverage conditions.
