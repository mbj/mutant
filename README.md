## What is Mutant?

Mutant is a mutation testing tool for Ruby.

 Mutation testing is the practice of systematically applying small changes one at a time to a codebase then re-running the (relevant) tests for each change.
 
## Why do I want it?

Mutation testing is an extra tool in your toolbox which detects uncovered semantics in your code. Coverage becomes a meaningful metric!

With each detection of uncovered semantics you have the opportunity to:

* Delete dead code
* Add (or improve a test) to cover the unwanted semantics.
* Learn something new about the semantics of Ruby and your direct and indirect dependencies.

## How Do I use it?

* Start with reading the [nomenclature](/docs/nomenclature.md) documentation.
* Then select and setup your [integration](/docs/nomenclature.md#integration), also make sure
  you can reproduce the examples in the integration specific documentation.
* Identify your preferred mutation testing strategy. It is recommended to start at the commit level,
  to test only the code you had been touching. See the [incremental](#only-mutating-changed-code)
  mutation testing documentation.

## Ruby Versions

Mutant currently only works on cRuby/MRI. Starting with version 2.5.x. It supports all syntax features upto and
including Ruby 2.6.

Support for 2.7 syntax features is pending, see unparser issue: https://github.com/mbj/unparser/issues/129.

Mutant will work under Ruby 2.7 just fine, unless a 2.7 syntax feature is used. This will be resolved shortly.

## Licensing

Mutant was recently transitioned commercial software, with a free usage plan for opensource projects.

Commercial projects have to acquire a license per developer, with unlimited repositories
per developer.

Opensource projects have to acquire their free license per repository.

The license distribution happens through the `mutant-license` gem in mutantâ€™s dependencies.
This gem is dynamically generated per licensee and comes with a unique license gem source
URL.

After signup for a license the following has to be added to your `Gemfile` replacing `${key}`
with the license key and `${plan}` with `com` for commercial or `oss` for opensource usage.

```ruby
source 'https://${plan}:${key}@gem.mutant.dev' do
  gem 'mutant-license'
end
```

The mutant license gem contains metadata that allows mutant to verify licensed use.

For commercial licenses mutant checks the git commit author or the configured git email to be in the set of licensed developers.

For opensource licenses mutant checks the git remotes against the license whitelist.
This allows the project maintainer to sign up and not bother collaborators with the details.

There are, apart from initial license gem installation, no remote interactions for
license validation.

To inquire for a license please contact [Markus Schirp](mailto:mbj@schirp-dso.com?subject=Mutant%20License).

### Pricing

Only relevant for commercial use.

Mutant offers a subscription model under a monthly plan.
Yearly prepayments with discounts are available.

For higher volumes different arrangements can be negotiated.

## Sponsoring

Mutant, as published in the opensource version, would not exist without the help
of [contributors](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/graphs/contributors) spending lots
of their private time.

Additionally, the following features where sponsored by organizations:

* The `mutant-minitest` integration was sponsored by [Arkency](https://arkency.com/)
* Mutant's initial concurrency support was sponsored by an undisclosed company that does  currently not wish to be listed here.
