mutant-rspec
============

Before starting with mutant its recommended to understand the
[nomenclature](/docs/nomenclature.md).

## Setup

To add mutant to your rspec code base you need to:

1. Add `mutant-rspec` as development dependency to your `Gemfile` or `.gemspec`

   This may look like:

   ```ruby
   # A gemfile
   gem 'mutant-rspec'
   ```

2. Run mutant against the rspec integration via the `--use rspec` flag.

## Run through example

This uses [mbj/auom](https://github.com/mbj/auom), a small library that
has 100% mutation coverage. Its tests execute very fast and do not have any IO
so its a good playground example to interact with.

All the setup described above is already done.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mbj/auom
cd auom
bundle install # gemfile references mutant-rspec already
bundle exec mutant --include lib --require auom --use rspec -- 'AUOM*'
```

This prints a report like:

```sh
Mutant environment:
Matcher:         #<Mutant::Matcher::Config match_expressions: [AUOM*]>
Integration:     Mutant::Integration::Rspec
Jobs:            8

Overhead:        -74.26%
Mutations/s:     19.47
Coverage:        100.00%
```

Now lets try adding some redundant (or unspecified) code:

```sh
patch -p1 <<'PATCH'
--- a/lib/auom/unit.rb
+++ b/lib/auom/unit.rb
@@ -170,7 +170,7 @@ module AUOM

       scalar, numerators   = resolve([*numerators], scalar, :*)
       scalar, denominators = resolve([*denominators], scalar, :/)

```

Running mutant again prints the following:

 end

Mutant configuration:
Matcher:         #<Mutant::Matcher::Config match_expressions: [AUOM*]>
Integration:     Mutant::Integration::Rspec
Jobs:            8

Mutations/s:     19.81
Coverage:        99.90%
```

This shows mutant detected the alive mutation. Which shows the conditional we deliberately added above is redundant.

Feel free to also remove some tests. Or do other modifications to either test or code.

Test-Selection
--------------

Mutation testing is slow. The key to making it fast is selecting the correct
set of tests to run.  Mutant currently supports the following built-in
strategy for selecting tests/specs:

Mutant uses the "longest rspec example group descriptions prefix match" to
select the tests to run.

Example for a subject like `Foo::Bar#baz` it will run all example groups with
description prefixes in `Foo::Bar#baz`, `Foo::Bar` and `Foo`. The order is
important, so if mutant finds example groups in the current prefix level,
these example groups *must* kill the mutation.

```sh
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec mutant -r ./config/environment --use rspec User
```
