            Original code was inserted unmutated. And the test did NOT PASS.
            Your tests do not pass initially or you found a bug in mutant / unparser.

            --- Internal failure ---
            BUG: A generated mutation did not result in exactly one diff hunk!
            This is an invariant violation by the mutation generation engine.

            ---- Noop failure -----
            No code was inserted. And the test did NOT PASS.
            This is typically a problem of your specs not passing unmutated.
